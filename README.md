# Dependencies
* [SFML (>= 2.5.0)](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)

_The version numbers are the ones that I've used, earlier versions may be sufficient but I have not tested them._

# Build
Make sure you're in the Scripts folder and then type `.\Build.ps1` in the PowerShell console. Make sure the execution policy is set to allow downloaded scripts to run. Also make sure that the paths to the SFML binaries and headers are correct.
